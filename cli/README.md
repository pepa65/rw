# Magic Wormhole CLI

A Rust implementation of the classic `magic-wormhole` command line client.

This package provides a library and a command-line tool named wormhole-rs, which makes it possible to get arbitrary-sized files and directories (or short pieces of text) from one computer to another. The two endpoints are identified by using identical "wormhole codes": in general, the sending machine generates and displays the code, which must then be typed into the receiving machine.
